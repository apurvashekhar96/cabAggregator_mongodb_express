# cabAggregator_mongodb_express

Taxi Aggregator API: A RESTful API server developed using Express and MongoDB for a taxi aggregator application. The server stores and manages driver data and allows manipulation of the data using API requests. Implemented advanced data filtering based on proximity to a location using MongoDB's geospatial query capabilities. Utilized Mongoose as an Object Document Mapper to interact with the MongoDB database. The API server demonstrates my skills in building RESTful APIs, data flow, data manipulation, and database management using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and advanced filtering techniques."
Skills: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js, Node.js, NPM package Manager, Git, JSON Server.
